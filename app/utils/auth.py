# The functools module contains several helper functions that we can use to change other functions.
# In fact, the wraps() function that we imported is a decorator itself!   
# We define a function called login_required() that expects to receive another function as an argument
# A decorator is intended to return a new functionâ€”hence, we have the wrapped_function(). 
# However, by returning a new function, we change the internal name of the original function. To clarify, printing callback.__name__ prints wrapped_function instead of callback. 
# That might not seem serious, but it can make debugging harder. Thankfully, the @wraps(func) decorator preserves the original name when creating the wrapped function.
# We want to preserve not only the name but any arguments that the original function received. 
# For example, callback('data') should translate to func('data') when called inside the decorator. 
# The *args and **kwargs keywords ensure that no matter how many arguments are given (if any), the wrapped_function() captures them all.
# Custom decorators are one of the trickier aspects of Python, so it's okay if this is a bit confusing.
