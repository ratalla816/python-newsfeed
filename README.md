  ## Description
  
   Use Python as the basis for a web server. 
   <br>
   Instead of building it from scratch, we'll refactor the back end of an app that was originally built using Node.js. 
   <br>
   The app, called Rob's Tech-Talk Emporium, lets users submit links to tech-related articles, comment on other users' articles, and upvote articles for points.

  ## Reflection
  
  Building this project helped us realize the power and elegance of Python - and that there is still much to learn!
  <br>
  Reflecting on what you recently learned is a proven strategy for making new knowledge stick.
  Spend a few minutes thinking about the following questions:

  * In your own words, describe the key ideas from this module.

  * Give an example of how each key idea is applied.

  * How do these key ideas relate to each other?

  * How do these key ideas relate to what you learned earlier in the course?

  * What are you still curious about?
